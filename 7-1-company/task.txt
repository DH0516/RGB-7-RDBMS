Create a new MySQL database called company.

Create the department's table with the following attributes:
ID (Primary Key)
Department_Name

Create the employee's table with the following attributes:
ID (Primary Key)
Employee_Name
Department_ID (Foreign key)

While defining the foreign key, remember to specify “ON DELETE CADCADE” – so that when a department is deleted, its corresponding employees will automatically be deleted.


Use SQL INSERT statement to insert at least three (3) records in the employees and departments tables.

Use SQL ALTER statement to change the employees table by adding salary column to it. Make sure that the value is not null.

Use SQL UPDATE statement to update the values of the salary column in the employees table.

Use SQL DELETE statement to delete a department from the department table and its corresponding employees in the employees table.

Use SQL SELECT statement to show the result of the two tables in your console.
